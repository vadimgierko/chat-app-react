# Realtime Chat App (PWA) built with React, TypeScript, Bootstrap & Firebase

This app allows you to **sign in/up with Google account** and start a chat with registered users from the users list for **free**.

You are able to see users' & interlocutors' **online status** & when they were **last seen**.

You will also get a **visual & sound notification** about new/ unseen messages.

The app can be optionally added to the desktop or phone screen & will automatically update to the newest version immediately when it will be available (no manual reloading or removing cookies needed).

The app is deployed on Vercel & available <a href="https://vg-chat-app-react.vercel.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Enjoy & invite your friends!

# Realtime Chat App (PWA) built with React, TypeScript, Bootstrap & Firebase

This app allows you to **sign in/up with Google account** and start a chat with registered users from the users list for **free**.

You are able to see users' & interlocutors' **online status**, when they were **last seen** & **last seen message**.

You will also get a **visual & sound notification** about new/ unseen messages.

You can send **multiline messages** & add **clickable links** to your messages, which will be opened in a different tab.

The **app can be** optionally **added to the** desktop or phone **screen** & will notify you about updates after reloading the app or closing the tab.

The app is deployed on Vercel & available <a href="https://vg-chat-app-react.vercel.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Enjoy & invite your friends!

PS. If you don't know any user of the app, feel free to start the chat with me (Vadim Gierko) to test the app & talk to the creator ðŸ˜‰
